1 , this concoction , so bizarre to the adult mind , is actually a charming triumph where its intended under 12 audience is concerned
1 , what makes the movie work to an admittedly limited extent is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk

1 , in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way
2 , as an actor 's showcase , hart 's war has much to recommend it , even if the top billed willis is not the most impressive player as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired
